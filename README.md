# Local Development Environment â€“ React Frontend & Next.js Backend with Docker & Ansible

This repository contains a fully automated local development environment, orchestrated with Docker Compose and provisioned via Ansible.  
Itâ€™s tailored for **rapid development** with instant code reloading, as well as **production-grade deployment** with health checks, restarts, and multi-architecture image builds.
